//! Asynchronous transformation flows and steps.
//!
//! These modules mirror the synchronous versions found in [`crate::sync`] but
//! operate on asynchronous functions. They are only compiled when the crate is
//! built with the `"async"` feature enabled.
//!
//! These flows use standard `async fn` and introduce minimal overhead.
//! For performance critical code, implementing your own `Async*Transformer`
//! traits directly may still be preferable.
