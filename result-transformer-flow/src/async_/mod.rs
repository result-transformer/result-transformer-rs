//! Asynchronous transformation flows and steps.
//!
//! These modules mirror the synchronous versions found in [`crate::sync`] but
//! operate on asynchronous functions. They are only compiled when the crate is
//! built with the `"async"` feature enabled.
//!
//! Because these flows rely on the [`async-trait`](https://docs.rs/async-trait)
//! crate, they incur additional runtime cost.  For performance critical code,
//! it is usually better to implement your own `Async*Transformer` traits
//! directly instead of building a flow graph.
